ssh -i foo.pem hostname      # Connect to hostname using the identity file
ssh user@hostname            # Connect to hostname using the user over the default SSH port 22
ssh user@hostname -p 8765    # Connect to hostname using the user over a custom port
ssh ssh://user@hostname:8765 # Connect to hostname using the user over a custom port
Set default user and port in ~/.ssh/config, so you can just enter the name next time:

$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host name
  User foo
